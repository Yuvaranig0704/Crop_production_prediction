**Predicting Crop Production Based on Agricultural Data

Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting crop production using historical agricultural data. By analyzing trends in area harvested, yield, and crop type across regions and years, the goal is to build a regression model that predicts crop production (in tons). The results support data-driven decision-making in agriculture, food security, supply chain planning, and policy formulation.

Objectives
Predict crop production using features like area harvested, yield, crop type, region, and year.

Analyze agricultural trends across crops and regions over time.

Provide actionable insights for farmers, policymakers, agri-businesses, and technology solutions.
